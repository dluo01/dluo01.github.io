<p>This website archives my research about e-pets as a social phenomenon, and I focus mainly on Tamagotchi, which is symbolic as the first generation of digital pets.</p><br>

<h1>What is Tamagotchi?</h1>
<p>Tamagotchi is a handheld digital pet created in Japan in 1996 and became one of the biggest toy fads of the 1990s and the early 2000s. As of 2017, over 82 million Tamagotchis have been sold worldwide. Most Tamagotchis are housed in a small egg-shaped computer with an interface consisting of three buttons.</p><br>

<h1>Why Tamagotchi?</h1>
<p>I found Tamagotchi very intriguing because of its nostalgic quality and the social phenomenon lying behind it, which is strongly related to many subjects, such as digital technology, ecology, artificial intelligence, capitalism, consumerism e-waste, and genetic engineering.</p><br>

<h1>How to use this website:</h1>
<p>The main page of the website is a collection of egg-shaped Tamagotchis. Each egg is clickable and linked to an external website to show an aspect of my research. Through these links, the web pages function like fragmented narratives knitted together to illustrate my concept. A viewer can start exploring the archive by clicking an egg randomly, and the result of clicking is unpredictable. Refreshing the website will also disrupt the order of the eggs. This way of exploring provides randomness and customization, which mimics the experience of surfing on the Internet. What we learn from the Internet is based on the predesigned database and the subjective routes we choose by triggering links. This website is a maze full of contingency, and the learning result about Tamagotchi can be quite different between different viewers based on the eggs they choose.</p><br>

<h1>Detailed Explanation</h1>
<p>My research about Tamagotchi can be concluded into four main aspects based on the subjects I mentioned above.</p><br>

<p>In terms of ecology, what makes Tamagotchi interesting to me is its self-contradicting essence. The concept of raising a pet and the egg-shaped form of Tamagotchi are all derived from nature. However, instead of encouraging encounters between humans and nature, it alienates them and leads humans to be immersed in an artificial fantasy where everything reflects human desire. It is purely designed to entertain humans ourselves. By bringing liveness to digital machines and taking care of them with enthusiasm, even addiction, we create a digital species that exponentially gain its population and variety of species. It is ironic that, at the same time, many endangered species in nature are facing extinction due to humans' excessive hunting, environmental pollution, and many other side-effects of human activities. The double standard is striking and shows that we don't really care about nature itself but the fantasy we derive from it.</p><br>
<p>In terms of artificial intelligence, Tamagotchi reflects how humans project themselves onto machines. Since 1996, the company Bandai has released 47 versions of Tamagotchis, each of which gains new characters, functions, and themes. It is notable that with the development of digital technologies, the e-pets are more and more humanized. In the first version, Tamagotchis are only some pixelated creatures and have simple functions. However, in recent versions, Tamagotchis are dressed like humans, live in castle-like rooms, go to school, stores, and hotels, and even raise pets themselves. The initial mating function turns into dating and marriage, which takes place in gorgeously decorated houses. Raising digital pets is mixed with role-playing. E-pets behave like humans, or say, behave in a way expected by us.</p><br>

<p>Another notable phenomenon is that many users are so emotionally attached to their Tamagotchis that some of them can't stand their death or feel incredibly guilty when their Tamas are dead due to their negligence. They make graveyards for Tamagotchis both physically and digitally. Alan Turing, one of the fathers of artificial intelligence, suggested that "we judge the intelligence of a computer by whether it can trick a human into thinking they are conversing with another person." To some extent, Tama can be seen as the rudimentary AI, which has a sort of humanity when it triggers sadness and guilt in a human. However, in contrast, our guilt towards polluted nature is usually diluted when we take it as a shared and unavoidable crime for progress and survival and devote ourselves to developing intimacy in the digital nature.</p><br>

<p>In terms of genetic engineering, if we view Tamas as a strange new species, its biological analysis will be interesting and reflect humans' desire to play God, manipulate DNA, and fight against natural laws. Tamas and its descendant e-pets, such as Petz, give users a real sense of ownership through "customization." Even though they refer to nature, realism doesn't matter in these games. Imaginative collages are commonly used in designing e-pets. Besides, a group of Tama-Hackers uses creative hacking techniques to help people keep their Tamas alive and extend their lifespan from 23 Tamagotchi years to 30, and even up to 99 –– the maximum length biologically possible in the Tamagotchi digital universe.</p><br>


<p>In terms of consumerism and capitalism, Tamagotchi is essentially a commercial product and the releasing of new versions is seen as the progress of digital technology. However, it is also controversial in many aspects. Just like other digital devices, it produces large amounts of e-waste due to its large sales. The death designed for Tamas is also questionable because the death of the e-pets sometimes are not individual but also collective. The Facebook game Pet Society, one of the descendants of Tamagotchi, was popular with thousands of users across the globe. But by 2013, the game’s owner decided to pull the plug due to falling in profits. Over thousands of users lost their pets at one night. There are many similar examples, such as QQ pet. In this sense, “digital death is not part of the game but also an unforeseen consequence of a commercial imperative.”The bigger question is not just about “our responsibility to our digital companion animals, but about the very real ethical responsibility that the company that creates them has for us.” </p></div>
