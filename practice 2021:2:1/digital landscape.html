	<div class="prompt">
	<p>Assigment prompt: Create a landscape by collaging found imagery. You may recreate an existing image or artwork of a landscape (think paintings, photographs), or create an entirely original landscape. Consider the source images you use, and how they relate to the composite whole - what material, ecological, or technological concepts do they reflect? How do you define landscape? Consider also the medium of Photoshop, and Carolyn Kane’s description of the ‘Photoshop Cinema.’ How does color feature into your piece? Do you want your audience to know the work was made in Photoshop or not?<br>Requirements:
	<li>Use at least 3 images.</li><li>Your landscape must be made using Photoshop and may only consist of found images.</li><li>Incorporate at least one photoshop tool, technique, or effect that is new to you.</li><li>Include your chosen reduce/reuse/recycle image.</li></p>

			<h2>Concept</h2><p style="font-size:large;">My starting point of the college is the background, which is inspired by the similarity I found between circuit boards and google map satellite images of many city landscapes. For instance, the satellite image of the Forbidden City looks exactly like a circuit board while the roads on the map look pretty like intertwined cables. This sets me thinking about the relationship between human society, nature, and electronic devices. Today’s civilization depends so heavily on digital technologies that we can see our fate through the way we treat them.</p>

	<p style="font-size:large;">The main structure of the landscape is a loop, which can be divided into two parts.The first part shows how human exploits the nature by turning its resources into large amounts of electronic devices, the so-called high technologies, in the name of progress. These devices are designed with a short lifespan to encourage customers to change their devices often. Old or broken devices all end up being useless trashes in the landfill, which are poisonous to nature but are usually treated randomly and poured from developed countries to developing countries.</p>

	<br><br><img src="files/digital landscape/detail3 copy.png" width="100%"><br><br>
	<p style="font-size:large;">The second part of the loop shows how the e-waste returns back to nature, or say, how we humans view the “recycling” process and the ecology as a whole. What I try to express here is that nature, to most of us, is usually an image produced by digital media and manipulated by humans ourselves. For example, the advertisements on televisions or a flyer produced by a travel agency. The fact that we polluted nature heavily is beautified and sometimes forgot. Instead of really caring about the environment and taking practical actions to help reduce or recycle the e-waste, we and seek comfort from the images of nature produced by digital media.  There always exists an emotional effect between the real nature and us and a physical distance between us and the landfill. We never resist the temptation of so-called progress.</p>
